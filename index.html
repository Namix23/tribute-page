        <h2>A Father's Influence</h2>
        <p>
          Nomura's father, played a huge part into growing Nomura's interests
          towards art and games. His dad would join him during his drawing
          sessions and play
          <a href="https://sengokudaimyo.com/sugoroku" target="_blank"
            >Sugoroku</a
          >, which his dad created additional obstacles and rules ontop of the
          game's general gameplay. With those newly, added obstacles in
          Sugoroku, Nomura created his own version of obstacles to play with his
          friends. And it didn't stop there. Once Nomura entered middle school,
          he was gifted a computer by his father who informed that they're
          entering a computer era. This is where he self-taught himself how to
          build video games through programming. Some would think this led him
          to join a gaming company soon right after, but this wasn't the case.
          “No, actually, I never even thought about joining a game company, at
          the time, I wanted to become a manga artist, and drew manga in the
          middle of class during high school, then showed it my friends during
          break.” Eventually, he was guided by his high school art teacher to
          check artworks from Final Fantasy Illustrator

          >
        </p>
        <h2>Job Searching</h2>
        <p>
          Although he created a manga in school with the hopes of following it
          as a career, he chose to look elsewhere. He decided to go to
          vocational school for advertising and magazine artwork. The idea in
          that moment was for him to find an advertising job at a publishing
          company, but just as life is unexpected, so are the opportunities life
          brings. And so, Nomura stumbled upon an employment magazine where
          <cite
            ><a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/home"
              >Square</a>
          </cite>
          (now known as Square Enix) was recruiting. The gaming company also
          included a drawing from Yoshitaka Amano on their recruitment page,
          which struck a core memory to Nomura of the time his high school
          teacher recommended this artist to him. In result, he took his
          chance and applied to the company as a character designer.
        </p>
        <h2>Standing Out</h2>
        <p>
          When Nomura was hired by <cite>Square</cite> during their final stages of releasing the game <cite>Final Fantasy II</cite> to North America, the company wasn't able to fully provide training to the newcomer. Instead, Nomura was told to debug with the testers. He continued working as a debugger until the company's staff was split apart later on, and he was sorted with the team in charge for <cite>Final Fantasy V</cite>. This was the moment he started to work as a character designer after he was trained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsuya_Takahashi">Tetsuya Takahashi</a>. Overtime, his consistent methods of presenting hand-written proposals along with doodles gained the director and event planner's attention, in which he was given the role graphic director for <cite>Final Fantasy VI</cite>. From then on, he worked on several game projects ranging from his role as a character designer with the characters' background stories noted to being a battle visual director for fighting scenes.
