        <h2>A Father's Influence</h2>
        <p>
          Nomura's father, played a huge part into growing Nomura's interests
          towards art and games. His dad would join him during his drawing
          sessions and play
          <a href="https://sengokudaimyo.com/sugoroku" target="_blank"
            >Sugoroku</a
          >, which his dad created additional obstacles and rules ontop of the
          game's general gameplay. With those newly, added obstacles in
          Sugoroku, Nomura created his own version of obstacles to play with his
          friends. And it didn't stop there. Once Nomura entered middle school,
          he was gifted a computer by his father who informed that they're
          entering a computer era. This is where he self-taught himself how to
          build video games through programming. Some would think this led him
          to join a gaming company soon right after, but this wasn't the case.
          “No, actually, I never even thought about joining a game company, at
          the time, I wanted to become a manga artist, and drew manga in the
          middle of class during high school, then showed it my friends during
          break.” Eventually, he was guided by his high school art teacher to
          check artworks from Final Fantasy Illustrator

        <h2>Job Searching</h2>
        <p>
          Although he created a manga in school with the hopes of following it
          as a career, he chose to look elsewhere. He decided to go to
          vocational school for advertising and magazine artwork. The idea in
          that moment was for him to find an advertising job at a publishing
          company, but just as life is unexpected, so are the opportunities life
          brings. And so, Nomura stumbled upon an employment magazine where
          <cite
            ><a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/home"
              >Square</a>
          </cite>
          (now known as Square Enix) was recruiting. The gaming company also
          included a drawing from Yoshitaka Amano on their recruitment page,
          which struck a core memory to Nomura of the time his high school
          teacher recommended this artist to him. In result, he took his
          chance and applied to the company as a character designer.

        <h2>Standing Out</h2>
        <p>
          When Nomura was hired by <cite>Square</cite> during their final stages of releasing the game <cite>Final Fantasy II</cite> to North America, the company wasn't able to fully provide training to the newcomer. Instead, Nomura was told to debug with the testers. He continued working as a debugger until the company's staff was split apart later on, and he was sorted with the team in charge for <cite>Final Fantasy V</cite>. This was the moment he started to work as a character designer after he was trained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsuya_Takahashi">Tetsuya Takahashi</a>. Overtime, his consistent methods of presenting hand-written proposals along with doodles gained the director and event planner's attention, in which he was given the role graphic director for <cite>Final Fantasy VI</cite>. From then on, he worked on several game projects ranging from his role as a character designer with the characters' background stories noted to being a battle visual director for fighting scenes.

        <h2>Convincing Disney</h2>
        <p>Nomura heard about a game being discussed in the works, that would possibly include <cite>Mickey Mouse</cite> as a character in the game. He was inspired to be a part of this project and so he attended his meeting with Disney. The Disney team shared their game ideas to Nomura but he ultimately rejected them all. Instead, he shared his idea inspired by Nintendo's <cite>Super Mario 64</cite>, which he proposed using his original characters with him being the character designer, and the main character being one of his characters who would travel across Disney worlds. Keep in mind, <cite>Square Enix</cite> hoped to use <cite>Mickey Mouse</cite> in a <abbr title="Role-playing game">RPG</abbr> as a main character. However, just like any company, Disney would decide whether they wanted to license out their original characters, or have certain rules implimented on how their characters are shown in the game. In the end, Disney approved Nomura's idea and informed Mickey Mouse could only appear once from afar in the game. Aside from character designing, Nomura also named and directed the game <cite>Kingdom Hearts</cite>, which was the start of an ongoing bond between Square Enix and Disney along with a growing <cite>Kingdom Hearts</cite> fanbase</p>
        </section>
        <p>And for those still wondering where Nomura included Mickey Mouse in Kingdom Hearts it was when he had his back on the camera, helping <a href="https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Sora">Sora</a> seal the door to Kingdom Hearts.</p>
        <aside><p>"Most importantly, I had to have the final say on the content of the game. Basically, without it, I wouldn't have been able to make the game I want. I had to have Kingdom Hearts come out in the way I envisioned."</p></aside>

          No, actually, I never even thought about joining a game company, at
          the time, I wanted to become a manga artist, and drew manga in the
